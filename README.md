  Response:
  ```json
  { "similarity": 0.82 }
  ```

- POST /best_match
  Request:
  ```json
  { "text": "bloody cloth", "candidates": ["glass", "letter", "handkerchief"] }
  ```
  Response:
  ```json

##  In-Game NLP Integration

Evidence matching (DetectiveGame/game/clues/evidence_system.rpy):
- 3-stage validation in check_evidence_input:
  1) NLP HTTP /best_match score ‚â• EVIDENCE_SIM_THRESHOLD
  2) Exact match against EVIDENCE_SYNONYMS
  3) Fuzzy fallback (difflib ratio ‚â• 0.8)

Interrogation (DetectiveGame/game/story/interrogation.rpy):
- Intent set: INTERROGATION_INTENTS (alibi, evidence, motive, relationships, accusation)
- Sanitization and relevance filters for smalltalk/emoji
- Classifier:
  - Primary: best_intent import (NLP), with a local difflib fallback
  - Wrapper get_question_category restricts to valid categories and applies thresholds
- Accusation parsing get_accused_suspect maps free text to suspects with synonyms and similarity checks

---

##  Testing

- Unit tests (service): add tests under nlp_service/tests/
- Manual checks:
  - Validate /best_match with evidence synonyms
  - Try multiple interrogation phrasings and confirm categories map as expected

---

##  Deployment (NLP Service)

Render.com example (nlp_service/.render.yaml):

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: blackthorn-nlp
    env: python
    region: oregon
    plan: free
    buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
    startCommand: waitress-serve --listen=0.0.0.0:$PORT nlp_service:app
    autoDeploy: true
```

Procfile: nlp_service/Procfile

---

##  Extending

- Add evidence synonyms:
  - Update EVIDENCE_SYNONYMS in DetectiveGame/game/clues/evidence_system.rpy
- Tune thresholds:
  - EVIDENCE_SIM_THRESHOLD and interrogation thresholds in get_question_category
- Expand interrogation coverage:
  - Add phrases to INTERROGATION_INTENTS and responses in SUSPECT_RESPONSES

---

##  Troubleshooting

- Evidence matching fails:
  - Ensure NLP service is running at 127.0.0.1:5000
  - Verify NLP_BEST_MATCH_URL and check nlp_service/logs/nlp_service.log
- Health checks fail:
  - Verify BLACKTHORN_NLP_MODEL or BLACKTHORN_NLP_MODEL_DIR availability
- CORS/405/404 errors:
  - Configure BLACKTHORN_NLP_CORS for your origin
- Ren‚ÄôPy cache/state issues:
  - Fully exit and relaunch the project to clear compiled state
